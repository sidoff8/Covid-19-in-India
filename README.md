# COVID-19 Forecast using ARIMA in India
COVID-19 (previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus) is a new respiratory virus first identified in Wuhan,
China is extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early diagnosis important but since it
would take time to develop a vaccine [1] the early projection of new COVID-19 cases will enable health care
professionals and government authorities to take proper steps needed to ensure correct measures that will
break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. The work introduced in this paper is a
commitment to displaying and estimating the spread of COVID-19,by using a time series approach. Our work
shows how the chronicled situation could be for country like India and to estimate future demand and how
these gauges influence the scenario. The historical data was utilized to create several autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA) models and the adequate model was chosen by four execution criteria: Dickey-Fuller
Test, Autocorrelation Function (ACF), Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF), and Standard errors.

# COVID-19 Forecast using ARIMA in India
 
[In this notebook](https://github.com/sidoff8/Covid-19-in-India/blob/master/Corona%20Cases%20in%20India-Analysis%20.ipynb) we have projected the number of cases per day in india till 30 may, and many other important projections have been made, The note book is self-explanatory in nature and has wonderfull visulization, so why to wait lets directly dive into the [notebook on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/bhrt97/corona-cases-in-india-analysis) as you cannot see visulisation here on github due to some constraints.

We used ARIMA model for forecasting with love.

##### Consider giving a upVote if you like the notebook <3

#### This is the Final Forecast which we have made 
##### Thus you can see that the number of cases will rise in India till 30 may considering that the lockdown is continued / social distancing is maintained, and towards the end of the may we will witness a fall in the number of cases in India.

###### PS : This graph is Number of new cases per day.
